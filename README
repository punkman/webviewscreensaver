Introduction
------------
A Mac OS X screen saver that displays a web page or a series of web pages.

The web page runs as though you opened it in Safari, but it will not accept
any keyboard or mouse input. The list of URLs it will can be set via
the "Options..." panel in the Screen Saver settings.

Usage
-----

1. Download from http://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver/downloads
2. Unpack the WebViewScreenSaver-x.x.zip file.
3. Double-click (Open) the WebViewScreenSaver.saver file and choose to install
   it.
4. Open up System Preferences > Desktop and Screen Saver > Screen Saver
5. Select "WebViewScreenSaver" (It'll be at the bottom of the Screen Savers list.)
6. Press "Options.." to setup the screensaver

Options
-------
Enter the URLs you would like to load and the duration to display (in seconds).
A duration of 0 seconds means infinite.

Check "Random start" if you want that the first URL loaded will be chosen random.
The next URL will be loaded cycling on the list as usual.

Check "Fetch URL Remotely" and enter a URL to JSON data in the textbox.  
This will download the list of URLs and durations from a remote server.
For the format of the JSON data refer to the apposite section.
